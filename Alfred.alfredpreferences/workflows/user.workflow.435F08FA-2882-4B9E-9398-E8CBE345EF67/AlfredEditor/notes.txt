Here I have some design notes to help me remember things I did to get other things to work. Sometimes it is very necessary to keep a list of these.

1) Change Codemirror's Codemirror.css file

The height of the editor is hard coded, which is okay for website, but not good for an editor. Therefore, that line needs to be commented out. As the following:

.CodeMirror {
  /* Set height, width, borders, and global font properties here */
  font-family: monospace;
  /* height: 300px; */
}

2) In vim.js, change the default keymap to sublime when in insert mode.
